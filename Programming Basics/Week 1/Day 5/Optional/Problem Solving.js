// 1. Strategy:
// One approach to tackle the problem is to use a loop to go through each element in the array and, for each element, check if it's negative. If it's negative, we can remove it from the array.

// 2. Pseudocode:
/*
  Function removeNegatives(arr)
    FOR i FROM 0 TO the length of arr
      IF arr[i] is less than or equal to 0
        Remove the element at index i from arr
        Decrement i by 1
      END IF
    END FOR
    RETURN arr
  END Function
*/

// 3. Answer:
// Problem-solving can be quite challenging. One of the toughest aspects is breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps and crafting algorithms to solve them. It demands a strong grasp of the issue, as well as critical thinking and creativity. Another challenge is determining the most efficient way to address the problem, especially when multiple solutions are possible. When implementing a solution, debugging and handling unexpected issues can also be difficult, necessitating patience and close attention to detail. In essence, problem-solving involves technical expertise, a strategic mindset, and the ability to adapt and learn from mistakes.
